## Bentley University 
this is free open source software that honestly is not good and doesn't provide much benefit so don't come after me.

## Notes
* "latest" mode may not be working, will update when I fix it. For now, specify the semester & insure there isn't a space between "semester" and the parenthesis for the date, ex. `COURSE=2024 Spring Semester(01/22/2024-05/08/2024)`

## Does it work?
To my knowledge these are the stats
| Semester     | Attempted Courses | Success Rate | Number of Users | Notes          |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Summer '22   | 3                 | 100%         | 1               | Test Session   |
| Fall '22     | 9                 | 100%         | 2               | Got a 1/1 seat |
| Spring '23   | 10                | 100%         | 2               | Got a 1/1 seat |
| Summer '23   | N/A               | N/A          | N/A             |                |
| Fall '23     | 10                | 100%         | 2               |                |
| Spring '24   | 9                 | 100%         | 1 (I ran 5 people) | Got 1/3 & 1/2 seat |
