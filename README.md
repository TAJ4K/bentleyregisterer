# Bentley University class registering software automation chromium nodejs typescript script

## How use
Step 1: Install NodeJS.\
Step 2: Clone git repo; `git clone https://github.com/TAJ4K/bentleyregisterer.git`.\
Step 3: Run `npm i` in project directory.\
Step 4: Fill out `.env.example` and change filename to just `.env`.\
Step 5: Ensure COURSE is correct (it's on workday, specifically the one from "Saved Schedules"). ~~Alternatively just put "latest"~~ *Broken temporarily*.\
Step 6: Run `npm run bns`.\

## Bentley University 
this is free open source software that honestly is not good and doesn't provide much benefit so don't come after me.

## Notes
* "latest" mode may not be working, will update when I fix it. For now, specify the semester & insure there isn't a space between "semester" and the parenthesis for the date, ex. `COURSE=2024 Spring Semester(01/22/2024-05/08/2024)`

## Does it work?
To my knowledge these are the stats
| Semester     | Attempted Courses | Success Rate | Number of Users | Notes          |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
